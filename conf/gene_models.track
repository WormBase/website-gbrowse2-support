citation     = These are gene predictions that have been reviewed by WormBase curators.  The
	purple and blue colors indicate CDS regions on the forward and
	reverse strands respectively.  The grey areas represent 5' and
	3' ESTs assigned automatically using the extents of
	overlapping ESTs and full-length cDNAs.  The UTR predictions
	have <b>not</b> been reviewed by WormBase curators, and are
	known to contain artifacts. If sufficient room is available
	between features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a
	small arrow is used.  The tRNAs are predicted by Sean Eddy's
	tRNAscan program, and miRNA transcripts taken from a variety
	of literature sources.
